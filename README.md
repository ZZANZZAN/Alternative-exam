#### You need a PIP program, if it is not, then do.
- #### If Windows: 

1. Download the install script get-pip.py (https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py). If you have Python 3.2, the version of get-pip.py should be the same. In any case, right-click on the link and click “Save As ...” and save the script to any safe folder, for example, in “Downloads”.

2. Open a command prompt and browse to the directory with the get-pip.py file.

3. Run the following command: 
> python get-pip.py
- #### If Linux:
> apt install python3-pip
#### Installing the necessary libraries:
To run the program, execute the following commands in the terminal:
> pip install numpy scikit-learn soundfile tkinter

If the Pandas library you have has a version greater than 1.0.1, then delete it:
> pip uninstall pandas

And install version 1.0.1 (If you did not have this library installed, then run only this command):
> pip install pandas==1.0.1

after installing the libraries, you can run the program.
